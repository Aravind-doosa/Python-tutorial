# python is defined as a high level interpreted programming language with a focus of simplicity and readability
# python : python is an interpreted language runs by step by step.It's designed to be easy to read and write
# emphasizing a clear and straightforward syntax.
# Python is versatile and can be used of various purpose, such as web development,data analysis,artificial intelligence

# DATA TYPES:
# Numbers: int,float,Complex,boolean
# String: Str
# Sequence: List,Tuple,range
# Binary: bytes,byte array
# Mapping:dict
# Set: Set,Frozen set
